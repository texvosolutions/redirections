# Purpose
- This repo is used to create short links for the QR or portal
- This is helpful when we need to change the links after QR creation or publication

# How it works
- It is deployed to github pages
- Github pages redirect all pags that is not / to 404.html
- 404.html reads the path param and redirect it to that link
